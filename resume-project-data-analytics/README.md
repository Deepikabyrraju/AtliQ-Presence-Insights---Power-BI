# AtliQ Presence Insights - Power BI Dashboard

The AtliQ Presence Insights dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attendance data collected over three months (April, May, and June 2022). The goal of this project is to help the HR team understand workforce presence patterns, identify attendance issues early, and improve overall employee productivity.

Using Power BI, the raw attendance logs were cleaned, combined, and transformed into an interactive dashboard that highlights key performance indicators such as overall attendance percentage, work-from-home (WFH) trends, and sick leave (SL) rates.

Key Highlights :-

Overall Attendance Rate: ~94%

Work From Home (WFH): ~9.1%

Sick Leave (SL): ~0.4%

Clear month-wise, week-wise, and day-wise trends

Employee-level insights on Present Days, WFH Days, and SL Days


Purpose of the Dashboard:-

This project helps HR:

Monitor attendance performance across months

Detect unusual spikes in absence or WFH

Understand workforce discipline and availability

Analyze behaviour patterns for better planning

Make informed, data-driven decisions


This dashboard transforms HR attendance sheets into meaningful insights that enhance visibility and support effective workforce management.
